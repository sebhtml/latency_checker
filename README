latency_checker: a latency benchmark for multi-core multi-node systems
Copyright (C) 2012  Sébastien Boisvert

This benchmark tool measures the round trip latency.
It is useful to benchmark the latency of multi-core multi-node
systems where each node has 1 active network device and where
all the processor cores of a node heavily utilize the same network
device.

The code is in ansi C (ISO C 1990) and utilizes MPI (message passing interface).

Compile it with 

	make

And use it with

	mpiexec -n 4 -output-filename Result latency_checker

You will get one file per process (Result.1.0, Result.1.1, Result.1.2 and Result.1.3).
The option -output-filename is specific to Open-MPI, you may need to change 
that if you use another MPI library/runtime.


Each process will perform 100 000 exchanges. Each message has 4 000 bytes.
A exchange is done when process A sends a message to process B followed by
process B replying to process A. The round trip latency is the elapsed time
required by this process.



The number of exchanges can be changed with

	-exchanges 100000
	
and the message size can be changed with 

	-message-size 4000

.
