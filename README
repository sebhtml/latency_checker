This benchmark tool measures the round trip latency.

Compile it with 

	make

And use it with

	mpiexec -n 4 -output-filename latency_checker ./latency_checker


The number of exchanges can be set with

	-exchanges 100000
	
and the message size
can be set with 

	-message-size 4000

.

Each process will perform 100 000 exchanges. Each message has 4000 bytes.
A exchange is done when process I sends a message to process J followed by
process J replying to process I. The round trip latency is the elapsed time
required by this process.
